# MatchEngine 
Welcome to the documentation for the matchengine! The Matchengine is a system designed to match cancer patients to genomically driven clinical trials using Clinical Trial Markup Language (CTML) and patient clinical and genomic data. It utilizes the the MatchminerAPI and MatchminerUI for displaying trial match information.


The matchengine can be used on local instances that provide access to private data. If you are interested in the development of new features, or in setting up a local instance of the MatchMiner system, please see the documentation, or contact [matchminer@dfci.harvard.edu](https://app.gitbook.com/@matchminer/s/matchminer)
